Routes via React Router

(This is a minimum; you could have more than just these routes. These routes may be named as you wish.)

- [x] 1. /books - this could be the home page; this component should show all books in the libraryâ€™s catalog
- [ ] 2. /books/:id  - this component should display details of an individual book
- [ ] 3. /login and /register (This could alternatively be displayed in the profile instead of living in its own route.)
- [ ] 4. /account  - this component should show, at minimum:

-         Username or email of logged in user
-         List of all books a user has checked out (or a message indicating they have 0 books checked out if applicable)
